    <h6>Pre school education is essential because it prepares the child for future school which will be allowed to build a base for his future education.
      It allows developing a child’s personality by exposing the creativity of the child in a natural way.
      Pre primary education helps to learn that how a child can adjust with his/her peers and interact with outsiders.
      It ensures the physical, mental and emotional growth of the child. The child develops his cognitive skills in the scientific curriculum that nurtures the child.</h6>
    <h5>Our Approach</h5>
    <h6>At KRKV, we make teaching fun for children. We try to build a good foundation for the child by imparting education in a visual way rather than just the theoretical way. We carry out different activites from time to time so that learning
      becomes fun and the child is able to understand things quickly.</h6>

    <h5 id="second">Primary</h5>
    <h6>Primary schooling encourages students to build on their prior knowledge and to develop a desire to learn more. We see their adventurous spirit and quest for knowledge in action as they advance through this stage, inspired by the desire to
      learn and build on the foundation that they have imbibed through their acquired skills.</h6>
    <h5>Our Approach</h5>
    <h6>At KRKV, we place great emphasis on learning and understanding concepts through a curriculum that is tailored to prepare students for secondary school. The program is simple to follow, but it pushes the child to reach his full potential.
      The Primary curriculum is age-appropriate and developmental in nature, reflecting the changing requirements of young learners. Various activities are offered to enable children to explore their multiple talents</h6>

      <h5 id="third">Secondary</h5>
    <h6>Senior School is the start of a child's path toward self-identity. As 11-12 years old children no longer require teaching or care. Rather, they require a nurturing environment in which they can flourish and develop into fully formed
      individuals.</h6>
    <h5>Our Approach</h5>
    <h6>At KRKV, we have the enormous responsibility of moulding a child's personality - emotionally, physically, intellectually, spiritually, and socially. Right guidance at this age shapes a person's personality for the rest of his or her life.
      Classroom learning is characterised by disruption and innovation, as well as a focus on skill development. Every child has the opportunity to polish his or her skills in sports, dance, and music, as well as the Performing Arts.</h6>

    <h5 id="fourth">Senior-Secondary</h5>

      admission into their dream college </h6>
